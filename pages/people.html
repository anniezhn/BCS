Tanenhaus is the Beverly Petterson Bishop and Charles W. Bishop Professor of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and Linguistics at the University of Rochester. Tanenhaus received a B.S. in Speech and Hearing Sciences from the University of Iowa in 1973, where he graduated with special honors, highest distinction, and won an Outstanding Senior Achievement Award. He received a Ph.D. in Psychology from Columbia University in 1978. He joined the faculty at Wayne State University in 1977, moving to the University of Rochester in 1983.  Past administrative positions have included Director of the Cognitive Science Program, Chair of the Department of Psychology, Acting Chair of the Department of Linguistics, and Director of the Center for Language Sciences. Tanenhaus received the University Award for Excellence in Graduate Teaching in 2002 from the University of Rochester (Forty of the Ph.D. and Post-doctoral fellows he has mentored have academic appointments, including more than 30 who are tenured faculty at major research universities).  Tanenhaus is an Alumni Fellow of the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Iowa and a Fellow of the Association for Psychological Sciences (APS); American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS); Cognitive Science Society; and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Tanenhausâ€™ research has focused on a wide range of topics in real-time language processing, including speech perception, spoken and visual word recognition, syntactic processing, reference resolution and generation, prosody, and conversation in collaborative tasks. In the 1980s and early 1990s, Tanenhaus and his students used ambiguity resolution as a vehicle for examining how information is coordinated during real-time language processing, addressing questions such as: (a) how is information from different linguistic subsystems represented, accessed, and combined; (b) how are linguistic, perceptual and conceptual representations integrated and how do they interact during processing; and (c) to what extent is language processing accomplished by specialized modules that operate according to principles unique to language (as contrasted with more general principles of information integration common to other perceptual and cognitive domains).  This work demonstrated that syntactic ambiguity resolution involves rapid integration of probabilistic constraints, including rich lexical representations, results that help form the foundation of current probabilistic approaches."/>
