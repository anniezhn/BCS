To address this question, we have collected a small corpus composed of pairs of participants working together to complete a card game based on the Enterprises Inc. game called SET.  By controlling the information each participant has access to, we can reasonably determine the likely intention behind a particular speaker's utterance and investigate how features of the discourse, along with syntax and lexical choices, affect that speaker's use of intonation.">

We developed a targeted language game with eye-tracking that allowed us to tie particular intentions (asking vs telling), as signaled by different boundary tones, to specific moves in a game, and consequently different fixation patterns.  We find that participants rapidly integrate the information conveyed by the boundary tones while also taking into account the lexical choices of the speaker. We are now working towards understanding when precisely in the acoustic signal listeners are able to identify the upcoming boundary tone, as opposed to the nuclear pitch accent.">

For example, if we say &quot;I can't find my left shoe&quot;, then it is inferred that the right shoe has already been found. However, when it comes to children, it has been shown that they have more trouble inferring from adjectives, especially color adjectives. Our project looks into whether a priming task can help children infer from adjectives. This task is designed to help children understand the feature differences between target objects, and possibly improve their performance with inferring from other types of informative adjectives.">
